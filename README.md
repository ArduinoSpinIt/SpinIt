SpinIt is a bicycle racing game, controlled by physical bikes which are connected to an exercise device. The game allows it's players to do a spinning workout while they are playing. There is also a standalone app, which provides the player details about his cycling performance.


The Spin-It app on the phone/tablet provides the user with his riding time, current speed, the distance he has passed, and shows him some statistics regarding his riding history.
